# Multi-Perk Mod for Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Zombies

## Overview
This mod enhances the classic Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Zombies experience by introducing **Multi-Perk Scaling**, a feature that scales the price and effects of the vanilla perks dynamically. As players stack perks, their effects grow in power, but so does the price, providing a fresh strategic layer to the gameplay.

### Key Features
- **Scaling Perks**: Vanilla perks (Juggernog, Mule Kick, etc.) have effects and prices that scale as more perks are added.
- **Increased Replayability**: Encourages unique strategies based on scaling perks and dynamic pricing.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work naturally with the existing maps and mechanics.

### Installation
1. Download the compiled file from [here](https://github.com/ReFraX32/BO2-Zombies-Multi-Perks/releases/tag/release) and place it in the `Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm` folder.
2. Start a Zombies game and enjoy the enhanced perks system!

### Compatibility
- Works on **Black Ops 2 Zombies vanilla maps**
- Requires testing with other mods to ensure compatibility.

### Notes
- Feedback and bug reports are welcome.
- This mod scales only the vanilla perks and does not include custom perks (unless specified in future updates).
